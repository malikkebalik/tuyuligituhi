あるメンバーの人の道に外れた行動が解散の決定打になったとされていますが、それがなくてもボーカルのyasuさんの体調不良で長く活動はしてませんでした。
ファンに解散の噂をされては、何だかんだで残り続けたJanne Da Arc。
正直、正式な解散発表はとんでもない不意打ちでした。
yasuさんはAcid Black Cherryも含めて大勢のファンを待たせてる状態です。
今回のJanne Da Arcの解散以降、どんな言及をされるのか注目されていました。
そして解散から１７日が経った今日の４月１８日に、ホームページにてついにyasuさんが解散についての心境を告白しました。
yasuがJanne Da Arc解散の心境告白
Janne Da Arc解散
正直なところ、こんなにたくさんの人達に惜しまれるバンドにまでなれたんだなと、初めて実感しています。
これほどバンドマン冥利につきるものはないです。
そんな皆さんにとっても大切なものをなくしてしまうのは本当に心苦しいけれど
守ることは残すことだけじゃないって事が僕達の答えです。
決していい終わり方ではないけれど、色んなコメントを読めば読むほど、13年近く活動してないバンドを支え続けてたファンの皆さんには感謝しかありません。
本当に本当に今までありがとうございました。
そしてこんな形での報告になってしまった事
本当に本当に申し訳ない。
でも忘れないでほしいのは
みんなも哀しいように
Janne Da Arcのメンバーも、そしてスタッフ、関係者のみんなも、そして僕も哀しいって事。
誰もこんな結末を望んでなかった事くらいわかってる。
でもね
わかっていてもどうしようもない事ってあるんだなって
うまく説明出来ないけど大人になるって事はそういう事なんだと思います。
このまま色んな事を話したい気持ちはあるけれど、敢えてこの言葉だけにした思いを察してもらえたら嬉しいです。
ここで僕の話を少しさせてください。
僕のパソコンの中にはAcid Black Cherryを始めると決めた時からJanne Da Arcの音源が一つも入っていません。
この意味はどう捉えてもらっても構わないけど、これが僕の生き方なんだと理解してもらえればと思います。
そして最近になって気づいた事があります。
もう少し自分を褒めてあげようと
僕が初めて
自分の事だけを優先して下した決断は、後にも先にもBLOODのツアー中止の時だけでした。
ぶっちゃけ体がおかしいと思い始めたのはErectのリハーサルの時
思い返せば、あの時もっと素直に体のシグナルを捉えていればと思うと悔やまれてなりません。
ただそれは結果論
でもそれも含めて乗り越えてきたから今があるんだと
これだけは自信を持って言えることです。
プロデューサーにも二度目の手術の時に伝えてあります。
三度目はないと
今やっと、今までの自分にお疲れ様でしたと言える。
本当によく頑張ってきたって
解散の文字を見て初めて涙が出ました。
みんなにとってJanne Da Arcは青春の1ページだと思うけど、僕達にとっては青春そのものです。</description></item><item><title>Arthel Neville</title><link>/arthel-neville.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/arthel-neville.html</guid><description>Arthel Neville estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles &amp;amp; many more details have been updated below.

実は帰国子女であることは、一般的には知られていません。
現在でもRADWIMPSの楽曲の中には、
英語の曲も多く収録されており、
出だしの頃に限っては英語が中心のバンドでした。
最近では、ブレイクした映画「君の名は。」の主題歌を、
映画の海外上映に合わせて「前前前世」の英語版が出されました。
野田洋次郎さんの英語の歌の発音はなかなかよく、
何かも無理や違和感を感じません。
しかし、実際には野田洋次郎さんの英語力はどれほどのレベルなのでしょうか？
野田洋次郎の英語(帰国子女)
RADWIMPSといえば、
日本語遊びの歌詞センスがよく、
その独自の表現がユーザーに評価されてます。
その一方で、
英語の歌詞の曲も、「まるで別のバンドみたい」と、
野田洋次郎さんの英語の歌も高評価なのです。
幼少期を海外で過ごした経験から、野田洋次郎さんは英語の発音はよく、
作詞する際は、普通のボーカリストよりもスムーズなのでしょう。
しかし、野田洋次郎さん本人に問えば、
海外にいた頃よりも、高校の頃の猛勉強の恩恵が強く、
自分の英語力はネイティブとはかけ離れてるそうです。
ちょっと素直すぎるというか、
カッコつけて「まぁね」と言わないあたりも、
野田洋次郎さんの魅力ですね・・・笑。
学生の頃から野田洋次郎さんは海外を意識しており、
バンドで食っていこうと夢みた頃から、
必然的に英語は重要と考えていたみたいです。
英語とロックの関わりの重要性に言及してたこともあったので、
野田洋次郎さんの英語への探究心はまだまだ続くと思います。
個人的は、英語版の「前前前世」が世界的に受け入れられれば、
RADWIMPSの海外へのレールになるのかな？と。
野田洋次郎が天才と呼ばれる理由 一度聞くと頭を離れない歌唱力と、
抜群の英語センス、作詞センス、
さらにはどの楽器もまんべんなくこなすという、
野田洋次郎さんの音楽性は非常にマルチで、
音楽関連のインタビューでも視野が広いことが伺えます。
歌が上手く、英語がうまく、楽器がなんでもできる、
このステータスだけを見れば、他にいますが、
野田洋次郎さんに関しては「才能を作品やライブで出してる」ということが重要です。
バンドの一部になってギターを弾けば、
ピアノでの弾き語りもできます。
また、英語の楽曲のクオリティの高さもあって、
まさに「天才」と評されてます。
日本語の言葉遊びのうまさも、
天才っぽく見られる大きな要因でしょう。
独自の音楽性を追求していって、
これからも大きく動きだす、
噴火寸前の火山のようなオーラも、
また彼の魅力の一つです。
飽くなき探究心で、
「うわっ」という音楽を作り続ける、
そんな予感を持つからこそ、
野田洋次郎さんは天才だと思われるのです。
